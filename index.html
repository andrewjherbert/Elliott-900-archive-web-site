The web site
<a href="https://andrewjherbert.github.io/Elliott-900-software-archive">
Elliott 900 software archive</a>
includes images of original Elliott paper tapes and cleaned up versions suitable for
punching out and running on a real 900 series computer and/or running on my simulator.
This web site can also be accessed accessed as a
<a href="https://github.com/andrewjherbert/Elliott-900-software-archive">
GitHub repository</a>.

<p>
The web site
<a href="https://andrewjherbert.github.io/Elliott-900-documentation">
Elliott-900-documentation</a>
contains scanned copies of printed Elliott manuals and related documents. This web site
can also be accessed as a
<a href="https://github.com/andrewjherbert/Elliott-900-documentation">
GitHub repository</a>.

<p>
The GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/andrewjherbert/Elliott-900-simulator">
Elliott-900-series-simulator</a>
contains a simulator system that allows Elliott 900 programs to be run on the
Microsoft Windows platform. It also includes runnable demonstrations of much of
the software in the archive. The simulator package includes a comprehensive
manual describing both the simulator and the programs used in the
demonstrations. It is often a more convenient and concise source that the
Elliott technical documentation from which it is derived.  The Simulator is
written in Microsoft F# and has been tested on Windows 7 and 10.

<p>
The GitHub repository <a
href="https://github.com/andrewjherbert/900-Simulator-in-C">
Elliott-900-series-simulator-in-C</a> contains a simple, portable, Elliott
900 simulator system written in C.  It simulates a generic 16K Elliott
900 series machine.  The repository includes auxiliary programs to convert ASCII
program and data files to the equivalent Elliott paper tape "telecode" and
vice-versa. Shell scripts are provided to run demonstration Algol 60 and FORTRAN
programs and the Elliott X3 Function Test program.

The GitHub repository <a
href="https://github.com/andrewjherbert/900-Simulator-in-Python">
Elliott-900-series-simulator-in-Python</a> contains a simple, portable, Elliott
900 simulator system written in Python 3.  It simulates a generic 16K Elliott
900 series machine.  The repository includes auxiliary programs to convert ASCII
program and data files to the equivalent Elliott paper tape "telecode" and
vice-versa. Shell scripts are provided to run demonstration Algol 60 and FORTRAN
programs and the Elliott X3 Function Test program.

<p>
The GitHub repository
<a href="https://github.com/andrewjherbert/Elliott-900-simulator-utilities">
900-Simulator-Utilities</a>
includes useful Windows programs for decoding Elliott paper tape images
  and pretty printing Elliott 903 SIR programs.
  </p>
<p>The files in
<a href="Software%20Release%20Notes/">Software
Release Notes</a>: folder contains documentation of some my own 903 software
  written in the format of an original Elliott SRN (Software Release Note).
  </p>
<p>
The file
"<a href="ReleaseNotes.txt">ReleaseNotes.txt</a>" summarises the changes made in
the most recent update of the site.</p>
