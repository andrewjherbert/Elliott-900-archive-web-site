====================

AJH Algol

The main purpose of this update was to release AJH ALGOL, a new version
of Elliott Algol that consolidates 903 ALgol Issue 6, MASD ALgol and
Hunter Algol. It makes HUNTERP ALgol obsolete and this has been
withdrawn).

AJH ALGOl is included in both the paper tape archive and the Simulator
examples.

The paper tape archive includes sources and scripts for building AJH
Algol, starting from 903 Algol Issue 6.

The scripts contain Bowdler edits of the 903 Algol issue 6 sources (for
the 2 Pass and Large Program Systems).  These can be found in the 
"SCRIPTS" folder within the "HERBERT ARCHIVE" folder.

In the "MANUALS" folder there are two documents by the author.

The first document "Algol Interpreter Notes" augments the original 903
Algol system design documents with a description of the workings of the
Hunter interpreter, including the code sequences generated for various
Algol constructions.  (In the "TESTS" folder in the "HERBERT ARCHIVE"
there are copies of the programs to generate these and confirm the
correct functioning of the interpreter).

The second document "Algol Recovery Project" - describes how sources for
903, Hunter and AJH Algol were constructed from the surviving tapes in
the Don Hunter paper tape collection.


Music Programs

It has been found experimentally that the “tuning” of the loudspeaker on
each different 903 is unique to that machine, therefore to be in tune a
music playing program must be adjusted to each machine.  This generally
requires the use of an oscilloscope to measure the output frequency
corresponding to different instruction sequences (the signal is too
impure to use a digital guitar tuner or similar).

The music programs include a small utility, PLAYER, which can be used to
calibrate sequences for any desired frequency.


Simulator

There is a new version of the Windows PC Elliott 900 series simulator
that has various minor bug fixes included and some additional diagnostic
commands to help with the development of AJH Algol.  The simulator
manual has been broken up into a series of smaller documents to make it
easier to find and read sections on specific items.


Documentation

For fun, two Elliott style "Software Release Notices" have been issued,
one for AJH Algol and one for AJH Music.  The can be found in the
"Release Notes" folder.
